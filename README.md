# naturequest

## Welcome!
We made naturequest with the goal of helping people get outside more. Every day, a notification is sent out to users with a new challenge to take pictures with certain items outdoors. 

After taking your picture, see your what your friends did that day too!

## How to use
1. Download Expo Go on your mobile device
2. In your terminal:
```
   cd app
   yarn start expo --tunnel
```
3. A QR code should appear! If you have an Android, scan the QR code in Expo Go. If you have an iPhone, scan the QR code using the default camera app.
4. Sign up, log in, and you're good to go!
